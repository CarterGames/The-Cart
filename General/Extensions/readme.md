<p align=center>A collection of extensions scripts to help with some common value edits that take a lot of space/time to write.</p>

# Upcoming
- Transform Extensions
- Colour Extensions
- Int/Float/Double Extensions
- TryGet Extensions
- Canvas Extensions
- Canvas Group Extensions

# Usage

All of the scripts are extension classes so all methods in them are designed to be used like <code>ToString()</code> does. 

### Vector Extensions
Provides some useful methods for some vector math that I sometimes forget the ordering of or how to write off the top of my head.

Method | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
<code>DirectionTo</code> | Gets the direction to the inserted vector from the vector it is called from. | ![VectorExtDirectionTo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33253710/160922330-a61d4771-b177-4b21-8892-c104216546ef.png)
<code>Line</code> | Gets the line between both vectors. | ![VectorExtLine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33253710/160922335-78a06900-3172-4ba2-9b01-cd69d5a1090f.png)
<code>MidPoint</code> | Gets the middle point between the two vectors. | ![VectorExtMidPoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33253710/160922337-25f5529f-a057-4af5-b748-deb5d478d3cc.png)
