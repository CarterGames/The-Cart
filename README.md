# Erissa Library
> Version 0.1.0

A work in progress code library of verified systems that I use in my projects made publically available with documentation for all parts of the project. This will be updated in small steps as each system is tested and to ensure it works as it was intended before being publically released to the main branch. 

## Branches
- Main - The branch you should get the latest version of the project from.
- Release - The branch that I use to prep changes to the main branch.
- Develop - The branch where I commit work in progress changes to the project. Work in this branch should be considered unstable.

## Contents
It is still early days for this project, so more will be added once it has been verified & documented correctly. 
- Clamped Values
- Events System
- Get Dice Roll
- Min/Max Values
- Extension Methods

## Upcoming
- Reflection Helper
- Get Random/Chance
- Camera Shake
- Screen Wrapping
- Journal System
& More!

## How to install
Simply download the repo and import its contents into Unity or download the latest release and import the package into Unity with the custom package import. In the future there will be the git URL option as well, but that is a bit down the line. 

## F.A.Q
Why Erissa?
> Honestly, I just couldn't think of a project name for a code base that I actually liked. So, I just picked the first name to came to mind that sounded nice, and Erissa was that name. Its meaning is also approipate to the code I usally produce xD

What is the overall goal for this project?
> For me it is to have a stable base code library that I can adapt of work off in a variety of game projects. 

Why Unity?
> Its the engine I work in for my day job and is the one I'm most familiar with. 

Can I contribute to this project?
> At present I am not accepting contributions to the official repository. This is intended as a personal project for the time being. I may change this in the future. 

Can I make suggestions for changes?
> Ofcourse, if you find a flaw, please do let me know. You will be credited on both the homepage & section documentation as well as in the commit in question that fixes the issue.
