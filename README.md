## How to install
Simply download the repo and import its contents into Unity or download the latest release and import the package into Unity with the custom package import. Alternatively you can install the library as a package in the Unity package manager via the following URL:

https://github.com/CarterGames/The-Cart.git

## Docs
The docs for the project are still a work in progress. Each script is fairly well commented as is but it will all be documented over time before a full 1.x release. 

## Modules
From 0.6.x or later, some sections of the library are modularized into packages that are managed through a small editor window. The window lets you see all the modules with a brief description of what they do. Some will require other modules to be installed to function. Any code that didn't fit into the module's setup is now considered a part of the ```Core``` library that is always in your project from installation. Modules should only be managed through this window to ensure they are installed, updated, and removed correctly. The system may have errors if you remove modules manually for example.

In the future, any major system that isn't needed all the time will go into this module's system. Any setups you'd need for every project will be added to the core library. A guide on how to make your own modules will be coming in a future 0.6.x update along with full docs for all modules in the system.
